#' Experiment 1 of Dunn, Newell, & Kalish (2012)
#' 
#' Participants in this study completed one of two category-learning tasks over
#' 4 blocks of training (a within-participant factor) under one of 2 different
#' conditions (a between-participant factor). The dependent variables are the
#' proportions correct for each of two tasks defined according to the category
#' structure that participants learned. For the rule-based (RB) group, the cate-
#' gory structure was defined by a simple rule. For the information-integration
#' (II) group, the category structure was more complex and could not be defined
#' by a simple rule.
